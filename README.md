# ATTENDANCE-BASED MEAL SYSTEM

The integration of the Free Meal Monitoring System and Security Attendance System enables a unified platform where employee attendance data is securely validated and directly used to determine free meal eligibility. By leveraging RFID-based attendance verification, the system ensures that only authorized and present employees can claim meals, preventing misuse and improving operational efficiency.

This integrated approach provides real-time monitoring, enhanced security, accurate attendance tracking, and automated meal distribution, supported by administrative controls and comprehensive reporting.

   # Application Settings
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

4. **Database Setup**

   ```bash
   # Create the database
   mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE db_freemeal;"
   
   # Import the database schema
   mysql -u root -p db_freemeal < databases/db_freemeal.sql
   
   # Run additional setup if needed
   mysql -u root -p db_freemeal < databases/db_setup.sql
   ```

5. **Create Admin User**

   ```bash
   node scripts/create-user.js
   ```

6. **Start Development Server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

7. **Access the Application**
   - Main attendance interface: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - Admin dashboard: [http://localhost:3000/admin](http://localhost:3000/admin)

## 📖 Usage

### For Employees

1. Simply tap your RFID card on the reader
2. The system will automatically detect your card and log your free meal claimed
3. Visual and audio feedback will confirm the action
4. Claimed/Claimed Already status is automatically determined based on your last log

### For Administrators

1. Login to the admin dashboard at `/admin/login`
2. Use the dashboard to:
   - View real-time free meal statistics
   - Manage employee records
   - Monitor free meal logs

## 🔧 Configuration

### RFID Reader Setup
The system is designed to work with RFID readers that emulate keyboard input (HID mode). Most USB RFID readers support this functionality out of the box.

### Audio Configuration
Audio feedback files are located in `public/sounds/`. You can customize the audio files:
- `success.mp3` - Successful attendance log
- `error.mp3` - Failed attendance attempt
- `aray-ko.mp3` - Custom audio feedback
- `ml-voice.mp3` - Voice feedback

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `DB_HOST` | MySQL database host | Yes |
| `DB_USER` | MySQL username | Yes |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | MySQL password | Yes |
| `DB_NAME` | Database name | Yes |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | NextAuth.js secret key | Yes |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | Application URL | Yes |

### SMTP (Email) Configuration

To enable sending CSV reports via email, set the following environment variables (use Mailtrap for testing):

- `SMTP_HOST`
- `SMTP_PORT`
- `SMTP_USER`
- `SMTP_PASS`
- `FROM_EMAIL` (sender address used in outgoing messages)

**Usage:** On the Admin → Free Meal Logs page click the **Send Email** button, enter the recipient email address, and an email with the CSV attachment will be sent using the configured SMTP provider (Mailtrap recommended for development/testing).


## 🚀 Deployment

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Environment Setup for Production
1. Set up MySQL database on your production server
2. Configure environment variables for production
3. Ensure RFID reader drivers are installed on the client machines
4. Set up proper SSL certificates for HTTPS (recommended)
